## Motivation

Our main goal is to create a platform for infrastructure control without vendor lock-in, empowering teams to run, scale, and monitor their applications on their own terms. Acceleratio gives you:

- **Full ownership** of your infrastructure and data.
- **Portable deployments** across any cloud or on-premises environment.
- **Zero lock-in**: migrate providers or run hybrid environments at will.
